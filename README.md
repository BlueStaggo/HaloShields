This is a mod that reworks the Terraria health system and introduces shields from Halo. Listen to the glorious vroom vroom vroooooom of that shield recharging!
Note: For the initial release, this mod does not prioritize balancing. This mod is not yet intended for a full playthrough.

Mechanics:
- Max life is capped at 100; Life Crystals increase shield capacity instead.
- There is no life regeneration
- Damage dealt from shields is not reduced by defense
- More defense increases the speed of shield recharging.
