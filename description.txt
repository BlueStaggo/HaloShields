This is a mod that reworks the Terraria health system and introduces shields from Halo. Listen to the glorious vroom vroom vroooooom of that shield recharging!
Note: This mod may not be properly balanced. Try playing up to the end of the game if you want to test it out.

Mechanics:
- Max life is capped at 100; Life Crystals increase shield capacity instead
- There is no natural life regeneration
- Damage dealt from shields is not reduced by defense or higher difficulties
- More defense increases the speed of shield recharging
- Healing items are much less efficient
